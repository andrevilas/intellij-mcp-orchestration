# MCP Console â€” Desktop Shell (Electron)

This workspace bundles the Vite frontend inside an Electron shell so the
console can run as a desktop application. The backend remains an external
process (run via the Python API server).

## Quickstart

```bash
# 1) Install dependencies
pnpm --dir desktop install

# 2) Start the Vite dev server in another terminal
pnpm --dir app dev

# 3) Launch Electron pointing to the dev server
VITE_DEV_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:5173 pnpm --dir desktop exec electron .
```

## Packaging

```bash
# Build frontend + Electron bundle (outputs to ../dist/electron)
pnpm --dir desktop package:dist
```

> **Tip:** The packaging script expects `pnpm --dir app build` to have run,
which is executed automatically during `package`/`package:dist`.
