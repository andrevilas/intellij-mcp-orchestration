# MCP Console â€” Frontend App

This directory will host the browser-based Console MCP UI. The goal is to provide a lightweight client for local development and validation of MCP servers, sharing the same repository as the orchestration scripts.

## Planned Structure

- `src/`: React or other SPA source code (to be defined in later tasks).
- `public/`: Static assets.
- `package.json`: Front-end tooling (to be introduced once the framework is selected).

For now, the folder acts as a placeholder so future tasks can bootstrap the actual application without refactoring the repository layout again.
